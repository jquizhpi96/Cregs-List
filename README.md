# Cregs-List

## Project Description

Cregs-List is an Airtable and React build where the user is able to submit a profile of themselves or a Creg they know. From the homepage, the user is able to navigate to and click on an the profile image that leads to a corresponding page of their complete biography. The user can also create and delete profiles of Creg's on the app with a submitting a form. We accept all types of Cregs here, regardless of spelling. :)

## Wireframes

The wireframes displays first the homepage where the user will see a photo gallery of Creg's already in the webiste with their name included. The homepage also included a little introduction about the page and a form submit buttom for where the user will submit a form creating a bio (third wireframe). The second wireframes shows an outline of what the user will see when they clicked on the image.

- Display profile images on the home page in a grid style with their name included.
- Have the user be able to click on the image linking them to their profile page
- Have a nav bar to navigate the user back to the main page when clicked
- include a form submit on the nav bar for the user if they want to submit a profile

#### PostMVP

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: I have a good understanding of what I want my project to look like and I am confident in being able to render the data onto my app in react. I also have a good amount of excercises I can reference to.

### Weaknesses: I can get lost in algorithims when creating functions mostly because of the syntax and not undertsanong the purpose of some of them. I will have to look up the methods and functions online or if that doesnt work I'll go to TA hours for help. I am also not comfortable using CSS flexbox so I'm nervouse about that.

### Opportunities: This project will help me get a better understanding with react and vanilla JS and hopefully be a fun project for me to be creative.

### Threats: Whenever I get stuck with an error or an issue, I tend to be overwhelmed with the online research for debugging I give up. I'll need to make sure I keep a positive mindeset and ask for help when needed.
