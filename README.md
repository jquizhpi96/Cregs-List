The user can also create and delete profiles of Creg's on the app with a form sumbit. 


## Wireframes

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: I have a good understanding of what iI want my project to look like and I am coonfident in being able to render the date onto my app in react.  I also have a good amount of excercises I can reference to. 

### Weaknesses: I can get lost in algorithims when creating functions mostly because of the syntax and not undertsanong the purpose of some of them.  I will have to look up the methods and functions online or if that doesnt work I'll go to TA hours for help. I am also not comfortable using CSS flexbox so I'm nervouse about that.


### Opportunities: This project will help me get a better understanding with react and vanilla JS and hopefully be a fun project for me to be creative.

### Threats: Whenever I get stuck with an error or an issue, I tend to be overwhelmed with the online research for debugging I give up. I'll need to make sure I keep a positive mindeset and ask for help when needed.
